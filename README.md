# Synthetic Data Generation Demo â€” UK Retail Dataset  

Welcome to this synthetic data generation demo repository! This project showcases how to create realistic synthetic datasets using real-world tabular data, demonstrated here on a UK retail dataset with columns such as:

- Country  
- CustomerID  
- UnitPrice  
- InvoiceDate  
- Quantity  
- StockCode  

This dataset is designed for **LLM training** and AI development, enabling developers to work with realistic, privacy-safe data for modeling and experimentation.

## Why Synthetic Data Generation?

Synthetic data enables organizations to:

- **Preserve privacy while maintaining data utility** â€“ generate realistic datasets without exposing sensitive information.  
- **Accelerate AI and LLM development** â€“ augment limited datasets, reduce bias, and improve model performance.  
- **Enable safe data sharing and collaboration** â€“ use synthetic datasets across teams and projects without compliance risks.

By using this dataset, LLM developers can focus on **training, fine-tuning, and testing AI models** without worrying about data privacy or regulatory restrictions.

## About the UK Retail Dataset

The UK retail dataset contains transactional data with features common to many business domains:

| Column Name | Description                   |
|-------------|-------------------------------|
| Country     | Country of the transaction     |
| CustomerID  | Unique customer identifier     |
| UnitPrice   | Price per item                 |
| InvoiceDate | Date of invoice               |
| Quantity    | Number of items purchased      |
| StockCode   | Product stock keeping unit code |

These columns make this dataset ideal for demonstrating **synthetic data generation workflows** for tabular data, as well as LLM training applications for retail analytics.
